## Grade: Didn't submit
Pipex is a choice project and I've choosen minitalk; Therefore I'm unable to submit it. 
Done for consolidation of processes theme.

### Overview:
Given command line arguments in the format:
	./pipex <infile> <cmd1> <cmd2> <outfile>
_pipex_ replicates the pipe functionality of the shell.

2- Navigate to _lvl_2_pipex_ and run `make`
	
	cd 42_pipex/lvl_2_pipex && make
3- `make clean` so that you don't keep those object files that you won't need anymore

	make clean
4- Run _pipex_ with your desired arguments

## Disclaimer
> At [42School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(school)), almost every project must be written in accordance to the [Norm](./extras/en_norm.pdf), the schools' coding standard. As a result, the implementation of certain parts may appear strange and for sure had room for improvement.
